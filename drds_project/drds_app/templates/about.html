        <h2>About Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
        <p>Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).</p>
        <p>The primary risk factor for diabetic retinopathy is diabetes. Controlling your blood sugar levels and managing your diabetes effectively can help prevent or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p>
        
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>In the early stages, diabetic retinopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. However, as the condition progresses, common symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Blurry vision</li>
            <li>Difficulty seeing at night</li>
            <li>Seeing dark spots or floaters</li>
            <li>Sudden loss of vision</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>Taking steps to manage diabetes can significantly reduce the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Key prevention measures include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping blood sugar levels within the target range</li>
            <li>Regular eye exams to detect early signs</li>
            <li>Maintaining healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Treatment Options</h3>
        <p>There are several treatments available to help manage diabetic retinopathy, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laser therapy to reduce or stop the growth of abnormal blood vessels</li>
            <li>Injections of medications to reduce inflammation</li>
            <li>Surgical procedures in severe cases to remove blood from the eye or repair the retina</li>
        </ul>
